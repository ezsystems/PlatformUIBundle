Feature: Test the validations done on fields from PlatformUI - Integer fieldtype
    In order to validate the integer fieldtype
    As an Editor  user
    I need to be able to create and update content with integer fieldtypes

    #Background:
    #   Given I am logged in as an Editor in PlatformUI

    ##
    # Validate the existence of expected fields from a field type when creating a content
    ##
    @javascript
    Scenario: A Content of a Content Type that has an integer fieldtype must have an integer field
        Given a Content Type with an "integer" Field exists
        When I create a content of this type
        Then I should see an "integer" field

    @javascript
    Scenario: When editing a Content the label of an integer field must have the same name than field type from the respective Content Type
        Given a Content Type with an "integer" with field definition name "Quantity" exists
        When I create a content of this type
        Then I should see a "Quantity" label related with the "integer" field

    @javascript
    Scenario: The label of a required integer field of a Content must be marked as required
        Given a Content Type with a required "integer" with field definition name "Quantity" exists
        When I create a content of this type
        Then the "Quantity" field should be marked as required

    # Creating Content using a Content Type that has an Integer Field Type

    @javascript
    Scenario: Creating a valid integer Field works
        Given a Content Type with an "integer" Field exists
        When I create a content of this type
        And I set "10" as the Field Value
        And I publish the content
        Then the Content is successfully published

    @javascript
    Scenario: Creating a valid integer Field works when using a value within limited scope
        Given a Content Type with an "integer" Field exists with Properties:
            | Validator               | Value |
            | minimum value validator | 1     |
            | maximum value validator | 3     |
        When I create a content of this Type
        And I set "2" as the Field Value
        And I publish the content
        Then the Content is successfully published

    @javascript
    Scenario: Creating an invalid integer Field fails validation when using a value smaller than minimum value allowed
        Given a Content Type with an "integer" Field exists with Properties:
            | Validator               | Value |
            | minimum value validator | 1     |
            | maximum value validator | 3     |
        When I create a content of this Type
        And I set "0" as the Field Value
        And I publish the content
        Then Publishing fails with validation error message "The value should be more than or equal to 1"

    @javascript
    Scenario: Creating an invalid integer Field fails validation when using a value bigger than maximum value allowed
        Given a Content Type with an "integer" Field exists with Properties:
            | Validator               | Value |
            | minimum value validator | 1     |
            | maximum value validator | 3     |
        When I create a content of this Type
        And I set "4" as the Field Value
        And I publish the content
        Then Publishing fails with validation error message "The value should be less than or equal to 3"

    @javascript
    Scenario: Creating an invalid integer Field fails validation when using a string
        Given a Content Type with an "integer" Field exists
        When I create a content of this Type
        And I set "a" as the Field Value
        And I publish the content
        Then Publishing fails with validation error message "The value should be a valid integer number"

    @javascript
    Scenario: Creating an invalid integer Field fails validation when using a float
        Given a Content Type with an "integer" Field exists
        When I create a content of this Type
        And I set "1.5" as the Field Value
        And I publish the content
        Then Publishing fails with validation error message "The value should be a valid integer number"

    @javascript
    Scenario: Creating a required integer Field fails validation when using an empty value
        Given a Content Type with a required "integer" Field exists
        When I create a content of this type
        And I set an empty value as the Field Value
        And I publish the content
        Then Publishing fails with validation error message "This field is required"

    # Viewing content that has an integer fieldtype

        Given a Content Type with an "integer" Field exists
        And a Content of this type exists with "integer" Field Value set to "0"
