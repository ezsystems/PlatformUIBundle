### How to make a clean Pull Request:

1. Make sure your pull request has a correct title. For example in PlatformUI we use 'EZP-XXXXX: Title of the pull request'
2. In the description of the pull request:
⋅⋅* First add the JIRA link of your story.
⋅⋅* Then add a short description about what's in the pull request. If it's a bugfix explain why and how it fixes the issue.
⋅⋅* Sometimes a screenshot, or a screencast is a good way to show your work.
⋅⋅* Don't forget to mention if your code is tested (manual and unit tests, coverage...).
3. Make a last check of the code you've just pushed, for example you can check again:
⋅⋅* The coding standard errors like empty lines or missing / added spaces
⋅⋅* The naming. Begin you methods name by verbs (<verb>Something()). Try to be as descriptive as possible for your variables' name.
⋅⋅* Make sure all you methods are commented with up to date parameters and visibility of your methods
⋅⋅* Verify you don't have uneeded diff.
4. Check if ezrobot and Travis are ok.
5. Good job! You can now request a review!
